# NullAxis AI

A web-based chatbot application combining a user-friendly UI with a smart conversational agent.

## Features

- Sleek UI built with React and Tailwind CSS
- Fast and modern development using Vite
- Chatbot backend with Python (`app.py`)
- Customizable environment via `.env` file

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python (Flask or similar)
- Build Tools: Vite, PostCSS
- Linting: ESLint

- Install dependencies: npm install

- Run the frontend: npm run dev

- Run the backend: python app.py

While the chatbot functionality in my submitted version is strong, I found that this version offers a better UI. 
I kindly request that you consider this UI design for the final implementation. 
Due to time constraints, I wasnâ€™t able to integrate both, but I plan to combine the best elements of each for an improved result.
